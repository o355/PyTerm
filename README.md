# PyTerm (Python Terminal)
At the basic level, PyTerm is a "terminal emulator" for Python. But not really. It adds some cool, extra stuff.

Right now, the much needed Version 2.0 is coming, under rapid development. It contains a huge, huge, HUGE amount of UI improvements, fixes, updates, and unification across the board. 2.0 will also utilize file storage, and a new file structure, and a bunch of new improvements to programs.

Version 2.0 is scheduled to launch in December 2016, considering time constraints. The current version will soon be updated to 1.14 to help fix some bugs.
