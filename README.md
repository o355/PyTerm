# PyTerm (Python Terminal) - Beta Branch
Want a sneak peak at Version 2.0? Here's your chance.

The beta branch is where the somewhat stable builds of PyTerm come into play. While not updated as frequently, the beta builds provide a nice look into what's coming in Version 2.0.

If you want a really close look into Version 2.0, the indev branch is for you. But for those who want to see what's going on with PyTerm, here's your shot. Beta 1 is the currently released version, with Version 2 coming out soon.

Here's the beta roadmap:

- Beta 2: Reworking all existing programs with cool unification and updates.
- Beta 3: New programs!
- Beta 4: Touching things up. A lot of things.
- Beta 5: The final beta. That's it.
