# PyTerm (Python Terminal)
At the basic level, PyTerm is a "terminal emulator" for Python. But not really. It adds some cool, extra stuff.

Right now, the much needed Version 2.0 is coming, under rapid development. Version 2.0 is basically a whole overhaul in PyTerm. Everything is getting changed. UI changes, functionality changes, and lots of new programs.

You can see beta progress (albeit at a less stable state) in the Beta branch, where Beta 1 is currently available. You can also check out the indev branch, to see every bit of progress I make on PyTerm, towards new betas.

Version 2.0 is expected to hit your computer screens in Early 2017, or the equivalent of around 30-40 hours of coding. I could just code for lots of hours straight, and 2.0 would be out in an a few weeks. That's not how life works.
