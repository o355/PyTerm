# PyTerm (Python Terminal)
At the basic level, PyTerm is a "terminal emulator" for Python. But not really. It includes some...other stuff.

**PLEASE NOTE: PyTerm 2.0 is under development, which is a complete rewrite for PyTerm. It'll include lots of stuff, and lots of API changes. For now, if you want stability, use the LTS branch (1.15). Versioning is messed up, please blame me for that.**

# Current Versions
* Stable - 1.14 (updated a LONG time ago)
* LTS - 1.15 (updated some time ago)
* Beta - 2.0 Beta 3 (released mid-Jan 2017)
* Indev - 2.0 Beta 3/Beta 4 (updated recently)

Use the Stable/LTS branch for the best experience. If you want to take a look at new features, albeit at the risk of bad stability, use the Beta/Indev branch.
