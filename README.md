# PyTerm (Python Terminal) - Indev Branch
Want to *somewhat literally* stalk me as I develop PyTerm?

The InDev branch is for you. Updated whenever I work on PyTerm, you'll come along for the stalking ride of your life on how I develop PyTerm. 

The Indev programs published are buggy, not unified, and I'll commit what I've done, even if it's broken (depending on how I feel, as well). So, use the beta branch if you want a beta level, but not indev level development build. That didn't make sense.

More betas will get released...soon.
