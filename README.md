# PyTerm (Python Terminal)
At the basic level, PyTerm is a "terminal emulator" for Python. But not really. It adds some cool, extra stuff.

Right now, the much needed Version 2.0 is coming, under rapid development. Version 2.0 is basically a whole overhaul in PyTerm. Everything is getting changed. UI changes, functionality changes, and lots of new programs.

Let's clear up all the branches around here, before going any future.

The master branch (where you are currently) is where the stable, good code godes. No betas, no indev builds, the stable builds.

The lts branch is where older, but still supported versions of PyTerm go. It's like a mini-archive for PyTerm, but it still gets bug fixes.

The beta branch is where beta code of PyTerm goes. Still somewhat stable, but it's your chance to take a peek at what's coming soon.

Lastly, the indev branch is where I develop PyTerm in. It's extremely unstable, and I push updates on a daily basis. I don't mind even posting a build that doesn't work at all.

Version 2.0 should be finished in Early 2017. It's a huge update, and requires 30-40 hours of coding time, even more.
