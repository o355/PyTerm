# PyTerm (Python Terminal)
At the basic level, PyTerm is a "terminal emulator" for Python. But not really. It includes some...other stuff.

**Please be noted: The master branch currently stuck in Version 1.14, due to a version screwup. Instead, please use the LTS' branch v1.15 instead, as that is maintained. Version 2.0 is coming along soon, in which semantic versioning will get used.**

# Current Versions
* Stable - 1.14 (updated a LONG time ago)
* LTS - 1.15 (updated some time ago)
* Beta - 2.0 Beta 2
* Indev - 2.0 Beta 2/Beta 3

Use the Stable/LTS branch for the best experience. If you want to take a look at new features, albeit at the risk of bad stability, use the Beta/Indev branch.
