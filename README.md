# PyTerm (Python Terminal) - Beta Branch
Want a sneak peak at Version 2.0? Here's your chance.

November 2016 Update: Beta 2 is around the corner, and it'll finish most of what I want in PyTerm. It's a HUGE beta, and taking lots of time to finish up. Betas 3 and on will probably have less cool stuff, but I'm working as hard as I can on PyTerm.

Another huge thing for PyTerm is that I'll start compiling PyTerm as an exe file after I finish all the betas! I'll have more details later.

Many betas are coming, and as milestones are met, I'll push more betas until the software is done. Full disclosure, things may be out of whack, or just straight up buggy, and unfinished.

The betas are supposed to give you a feel for what 2.0 will feel and look like, and not be a finished product. Proceed at your own risk.
