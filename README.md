# PyTerm (Python Terminal) - Beta Branch
Want a sneak peak at Version 2.0? Here's your chance.

Many betas are coming, and as milestones are met, I'll push more betas until the software is done. Full disclosure, things may be out of whack, or just straight up buggy, and unfinished.

The betas are supposed to give you a feel for what 2.0 will feel and look like, and not be a finished product. Proceed at your own risk.
